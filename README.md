Code for tidal simulator and unpredictable limpet substrate heating using Arduino Yun. Note there is considerable unused code (commented out) at the bottom of the file. Some of this is for use with an LCD, but given memory constraints on the YUN was unused. Additionally, initially different heating profiles were applied as the temperatures increased and this code is still visible (thought commented out) in the heating function. At this point it should just be removed as it was determined later that it was unnecessary. If at some point I have time I'll clean up the remaining code a bit. The combined use of timer and millisecond timers is messy, but given time constraints and similar memory constraints above, once the code would fit and run on the YUN we used it. Additional, fine-tuning can certainly be done if there is time to return to this code.
